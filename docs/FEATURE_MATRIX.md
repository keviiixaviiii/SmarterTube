# SmarterTube Feature Matrix

Status of visible phone/tablet features. This is a living document — update the affected rows
with every change (see [RELEASE_PROCESS.md](RELEASE_PROCESS.md) → Agent Change Discipline).

Status values:

- **Works** — verified working on a real device.
- **Partially works** — usable but with known gaps (see Notes / [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md)).
- **Broken** — present but does not work.
- **Not implemented** — intentionally absent for now.
- **Not applicable** — does not apply to the phone/tablet product.
- **Unknown** — not yet verified on a device.

> **Unknown blocks a stable (1.0) release** for core user flows. Beta releases may ship with
> Unknown rows, but they must be listed here honestly rather than assumed to work.

Last reviewed for: `v0.4.2-beta.8+st31.94`. Rows re-verified on a device this cycle: Shorts
playback (seek bar, auto-hide, swipe-to-next), Settings screen (bottom-sheet panel over player,
Back navigation). Other rows are carried from prior shipped behaviour — treat anything not
explicitly re-tested as provisional and confirm against the release checklist before 1.0.

## Browsing & navigation
